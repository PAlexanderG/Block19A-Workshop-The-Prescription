As there are numerous scenarios, and a lot of math involved, the company wants to perform test cases using the Jest tool before deploying the new site.

Write as many tests as you can, given the discount and coupon in the Starter code link provided in Step-3 of Directions. Every conceivable test case for the given Javascript file must be run using Jest. Write and run as many different test cases as possible after a thorough analysis of the output. -->

<!-- Directions
1. Review the Services and Packages above.

2. Using pseudocode, write as many tests as possible.

3. Open this LinkLinks to an external site. and enter the starter code. It has directions in case you have to write a test. Also, some sample test cases are given.

4. To write code for your test scenarios, create a file called prescription.test.js.

5. Execute the following command in the terminal to include the package.json file: npm init -y.

6. Make sure to include any relevant dependencies in the package.json file.

7. The prescription.js Javascript file contains functions that compute the total and discount.

8. To compose your test cases, create a prescription.test.js file.

9. Pseudocode each test case before writing code.

10. Verify that all test cases are successful by executing the given command on the terminal: run npm test. -->
